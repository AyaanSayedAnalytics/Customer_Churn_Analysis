# Customer Churn Analysis & Dashboard

## Overview

This project analyses customer churn to identify:

* Churn rate
* Revenue at risk
* Key drivers of customer attrition

Workflow:

1. SQL data preparation
2. Python exploratory analysis
3. Power BI dashboard

---

## Tools Used

* **SQL Server** – Created cleaned view (`v_churn`)
* **Python** – pandas, matplotlib, seaborn (EDA, comparisons, correlations)
* **Power BI** – KPI measures, segmentation analysis, revenue impact

---

## Key Metrics

* Total Customers
* Total Churned Customers
* Churn Rate (~14.5%)
* Revenue at Risk
* Average Monthly Charge
* Churn by tenure, contract renewal, and pricing bands

---

## Key Insights

* Customers without contract renewal churn significantly more.
* Churn varies by tenure band.
* Revenue risk is concentrated in specific segments.
* Higher pricing tiers show elevated churn rates.

## Output

* Executive overview page (KPIs + high-level trends)
* Churn drivers page (segmented analysis with slicers)
* Interactive Power BI dashboard
